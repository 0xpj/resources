# Binary Exploitation

## Quick Start
* For C and C++ programs:
    * Does the program use functions like that do not check user input gets, strcpy, or sprintf?
	* If so, possible buffer overflow vulnerability!
    * Does the program use printf or snprintf without using a format specifier?
        * If so, possible format string vulnerability!

## About
> Binary exploitation is the process of identifying and taking advantage of
> vulnerabilities in compiled code. They can be used to read or corrupt memory,
> crash a program, or gain administrative access to a machine.
> In CTFs, the source code is usually written in C and the binaries, or
> executables, are in Linux ELF format.
